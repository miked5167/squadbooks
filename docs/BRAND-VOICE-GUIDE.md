# TeamTreasure Brand Voice & Terminology Guide

## Introduction

### Core Principle: Protection, Not Policing

TeamTreasure serves volunteer treasurers in tight-knit hockey communities where parents know each other personally. While our platform provides robust fraud prevention capabilities (essential post-OMHA scandal), our **internal UI language must protect and support treasurers**, not make them feel suspected or surveilled.

**The Rule:**
- 🛡️ **In-App/UI:** Protective, supportive language that frames features as safeguarding the treasurer
- 📢 **Marketing/External:** Confident fraud prevention messaging that emphasizes security and compliance
- 🤝 **League/B2B:** Serious, compliance-focused language highlighting accountability

**Why This Matters:**
Volunteer treasurers are doing their community a favor. If our UI treats them like potential criminals, they'll resist the software. But if we frame safeguards as protecting THEM from accusations and building parent trust, they'll embrace the features enthusiastically.

### ❌ Terms to Avoid in UI

| Term | Why Avoid | Better Alternative |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Fraud detection** | Implies suspicion of user | "Financial safeguards" |
| **Fraud prevention** | Save for marketing only | "Protection features" |
| **Catches thieves** | Accusatory, aggressive | "Verifies all transactions" |
| **Prevents theft** | Implies user is suspect | "Protects team funds" |
| **Stops embezzlement** | Too serious for UI | "Provides oversight" |
| **Suspicious activity** | Creates paranoia | "Requires verification" |
| **Unauthorized expenses** | Legalistic, cold | "Expenses pending approval" |
| **Red flags** | Alarm language | "Items needing review" |
| **Audit trail** | IRS/compliance tone | "Transaction history" |
| **Compliance enforcement** | Bureaucratic | "League requirements" |

### ⚠️ Strategic Terms (Marketing/PR Only)

These terms are powerful for external messaging but should NOT appear in UI:

- Fraud prevention system
- Embezzlement protection
- Catches financial irregularities
- Post-OMHA security measures
- Anti-theft features
- Compliance monitoring

## Decision Tree: When in Doubt

```
Is this copy visible to the end user (treasurer)?
│
├─ YES → Use protective, supportive language
│         Focus on: protection, verification, trust-building
│         Avoid: fraud, theft, suspicious, unauthorized
│
└─ NO → Is it for marketing/sales?
         │
         ├─ YES → You can use fraud prevention messaging
         │         Focus on: security, compliance, risk mitigation
         │
         └─ NO → Is it for league/B2B?
                  │
                  └─ YES → Use serious compliance language
                           Focus on: fiduciary duty, regulations, liability
```

### Quick Self-Check Questions:

1. **Would a volunteer treasurer feel trusted or suspected?**
   → If suspected, rewrite with protective language

2. **Does this focus on what we prevent or what we provide?**
   → Frame as providing protection, not preventing crime

3. **Would this work in a marketing deck to leagues?**
   → If yes, it's too aggressive for in-app UI

4. **Does this acknowledge the treasurer's volunteer role?**
   → Good UI copy shows we appreciate their service

5. **Would a hockey parent reading this feel reassured or alarmed?**
   → Reassured = good, Alarmed = rewrite

## Special Cases

### 1. Legal/Required Language

Sometimes you MUST use specific terminology for legal compliance (e.g., "Audit Trail" in API documentation for accountants). In these cases:

- Use the required term in backend/technical contexts
- Use friendlier synonyms in user-facing UI
- Example: Database field = `audit_trail`, UI label = "Transaction History"

### 2. Parent/Public-Facing Features

If parents see the UI (like a public transaction view):

- Use **even more** trust-building language
- Focus on transparency and verification
- Example: "Every expense verified by two team members" (not "dual authorization")

### 3. League Admin Dashboards

For league-level users managing multiple teams:

- More serious tone is acceptable
- Can reference compliance requirements
- Still avoid overtly accusatory language
- Example: "Ensure all teams meet oversight requirements" (not "Monitor teams for fraud")

### 4. Error States (Technical Issues)

Even technical errors should maintain supportive tone:

❌ **BAD:** "Transaction rejected: fraud detection system failure"
✅ **GOOD:** "We couldn't process this transaction. Please try again or contact support."

## Testing Your Copy

### The "Volunteer Mom Test"

Imagine explaining this feature to a volunteer hockey mom who's new to being treasurer. Would your copy:

- ✅ Make her feel supported and protected
- ✅ Build her confidence in using the software
- ✅ Show we appreciate her volunteer work
- ✅ Help her explain the system to parents

Or would it:

- ❌ Make her feel like she's under surveillance
- ❌ Create anxiety about making mistakes
- ❌ Imply we don't trust volunteers
- ❌ Use jargon she doesn't understand

### The "Hockey Parent Test"

If a hockey parent saw this UI copy, would they:

- ✅ Feel reassured their team funds are protected
- ✅ Appreciate the transparency
- ✅ Trust the treasurer more
- ✅ Understand what's happening with their money

Or would they:

- ❌ Think someone is stealing money
- ❌ Feel alarmed by aggressive language
- ❌ Wonder if the treasurer is suspected
- ❌ Get confused by compliance jargon

---

- [ ] Uses active voice and short sentences
- [ ] Acknowledges volunteer nature of the role
- [ ] Emphasizes trust-building with parents
- [ ] Professional but warm tone
- [ ] Specific and actionable (not vague)
- [ ] Would pass the "Volunteer Mom Test"
- [ ] Would pass the "Hockey Parent Test"

## Appendix: Real-World Inspiration

### What We Learned from User Testing

1. **Treasurers bristle at "audit" language** → Changed to "transaction history"
2. **Parents love "two-person verification"** → Use this phrase liberally
3. **"Protects you" resonates strongly** → Frame features as protecting the treasurer
4. **"League requirements" feels neutral** → Better than "compliance enforcement"
5. **"Builds trust" is a powerful motivator** → Emphasize parent relationships

### Industry Context We're Responding To

- **OMHA $2.4M scandal (2023):** Hockey community is aware and concerned
- **Volunteer burnout:** People don't want extra work or surveillance
- **Tight-knit communities:** Everyone knows each other; accusations destroy relationships
- **Parent expectations:** They want transparency but don't want drama
- **League pressure:** Organizations need to show they have safeguards without scaring volunteers

### Competitive Differentiation

Most financial software treats all users like potential fraudsters. Our competitive advantage is treating treasurers like the volunteers they are—providing them with safeguards that protect THEM, not just the money.

**Our positioning:** "We protect volunteer treasurers and build parent trust."
**Not:** "We catch embezzlers before they steal."

Both are true, but only one will get volunteers to adopt the software enthusiastically.
