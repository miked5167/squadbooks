## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature                                 | Reason                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Association users editing transactions  | Team treasurers own transaction data; association users provide oversight only |
| Association users uploading receipts    | Team treasurers upload receipts for their own transactions                     |
| Association users deleting transactions | Read-only oversight model; no mutation capabilities                            |
| Real-time notifications                 | Defer to v2; current focus is visibility, not alerting                         |
| Advanced analytics/reporting            | Defer to v2; v1 focuses on raw data access with basic filtering                |
| Receipt OCR/validation                  | Out of scope; manual verification sufficient for oversight                     |
| Mobile app                              | Web-first; responsive design for tablet/desktop, not native mobile             |
| Multi-association view                  | Association users scoped to single association                                 |
| Transaction approval workflow           | Existing budget approval handles this; oversight is post-facto review          |
