**Defined:** 2026-01-19
**Completed:** 2026-01-19
**Core Value:** Apply QuickBooks and FreshBooks design patterns to improve dashboard visual hierarchy, scannability, and professional polish

## Requirements

Requirements for applying QuickBooks and FreshBooks design patterns to improve dashboard visual hierarchy and scannability.

### Visual Hierarchy

- [x] **UX-01**: Apply QuickBooks 4px spacing grid system across all dashboard components (card padding p-6, grid gaps gap-4/gap-6, section spacing space-y-8)
  - **Status:** Complete
  - **Phase:** 5
  - **Evidence:** CardHeader space-y-2 (8px), p-6 (24px), gap-4/gap-6 in layouts
  - **Outcome:** Validated - All Card components use consistent 4px-based spacing

- [x] **UX-02**: Implement QuickBooks typography hierarchy with systematic type scale (12px badges, 14px labels, 18px headings, 30px metrics with appropriate font weights)
  - **Status:** Complete
  - **Phase:** 5
  - **Evidence:** CardTitle text-lg default, scale: 30px > 18px > 14px > 12px verified
  - **Outcome:** Validated - Typography hierarchy established app-wide, affects 107 files

### Status Indicators

- [x] **UX-03**: Enhance status badges with accessibility features including icons (CheckCircle for healthy, AlertTriangle for warning, AlertOctagon for critical) and WCAG 2.1 AA compliant colors (green-100/800, amber-100/800, red-100/800)
  - **Status:** Complete
  - **Phase:** 6
  - **Evidence:** Icons + aria-hidden pattern, amber-100/amber-800 warning variant, WCAG 2.1 AA contrast
  - **Outcome:** Validated - Accessible status badges with icon + color + text pattern

### Financial Visualizations

- [x] **UX-04**: Apply FreshBooks progress bar styling to budget indicators (8px height, rounded-full container, dynamic color thresholds: <75% green, 75-90% amber, >90% red, smooth 300ms transitions)
  - **Status:** Complete
  - **Phase:** 6
  - **Evidence:** h-2 (8px), thresholds at 70/90, transition-all duration-300
  - **Outcome:** Validated (with adjustment) - Thresholds changed to 70/90 instead of 75/90 for earlier warnings per FreshBooks best practices

### Teams Needing Attention Widget

- [x] **UX-05**: Implement FreshBooks "Outstanding Invoices" pattern with visual breakdown bar showing critical vs warning team distribution, numerical counts with color coding, and CTA button to review teams
  - **Status:** Complete
  - **Phase:** 6
  - **Evidence:** Breakdown bar with proportional segments, numerical legend, AlertOctagon/AlertTriangle icons
  - **Outcome:** Validated - Reusable TeamsNeedingAttentionWidget component with accessible pattern

## Requirements Adjustments

| Requirement | Original Threshold                 | Adjusted To                         | Rationale                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UX-04       | <75% green, 75-90% amber, >90% red | <70% green, 70-90% amber, >=90% red | FreshBooks best practices recommend earlier warnings (70% instead of 75%) to give users more time to react |

## Out of Scope

| Feature                     | Reason                                   |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Complete dashboard redesign | v1.1 focuses on polish, not restructure  |
| New dashboard sections      | Only improving existing sections         |
| Data visualization charts   | Focus on UI polish, not new chart types  |
| Custom color theming        | Maintain HuddleBooks brand (navy/golden) |
| Dashboard layout reordering | Keep existing structure that works       |
| Mobile-specific dashboard   | Existing responsive design sufficient    |

## Human Verification Checklist

Requirements completed but recommend human verification for:

### Visual Quality (UX-01, UX-02)

- [ ] Visual hierarchy scannability - metrics (30px) visually dominant, headings (18px) distinct from labels (14px)
- [ ] Cross-app CardTitle rendering - 18px across dashboard, transactions, teams, settings pages
- [ ] Mobile responsive typography - readable at 320px width, no overflow

### Accessibility (UX-03)

- [ ] Screen reader testing - NVDA/JAWS with badge context and aria-labels
- [ ] Color contrast - WCAG 2.1 AA verification with contrast checker (amber-100/amber-800, green-100/green-800)
- [ ] Badge icon visibility - 14px icons distinguishable at normal viewing distance

### Visual Polish (UX-04, UX-05)

- [ ] Progress bar transitions - 300ms smooth color fades at thresholds
- [ ] Breakdown bar proportions - segments proportional to percentages
- [ ] Mobile responsive widget - TeamsNeedingAttentionWidget at 320px width, no horizontal scroll

## Tech Debt Identified

**Low priority cleanup opportunities (outside v1.1 scope):**

7 files with text-base overrides on CardTitle:

- components/budget/BudgetAllocationsTable.tsx
- components/budget/ApprovalProgress.tsx
- components/budget/FundingSourcesCard.tsx
- components/budget/CoachReviewActions.tsx
- components/budget/BudgetStatusPanel.tsx
- app/budget/[id]/review/page.tsx
- components/exceptions/ExceptionAnalytics.tsx

**Impact:** Low - budget/exceptions pages outside dashboard focus
**Recommendation:** Future cleanup for app-wide CardTitle consistency
