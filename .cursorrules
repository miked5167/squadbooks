# BRAND VOICE RULES FOR TEAMTREASURE
# ============================================

## UI Copy Standards

CRITICAL: When generating any user-facing text (labels, buttons, notifications, settings, help text):

1. NEVER use the word "fraud" in UI components
2. NEVER use "embezzlement", "theft", "stealing", "suspicious", "unauthorized"
3. ALWAYS use protective, supportive language instead

## Approved Terminology

### IN-APP UI (Use these):
- Financial protection
- Safeguards
- Verification
- Two-person approval
- Independent review
- Oversight
- Accountability
- Team approach
- Protects you
- Builds trust

### MARKETING PAGES ONLY (Limited use):
- Fraud prevention (only when discussing industry problems)
- Embezzlement protection (historical context)
- OMHA scandal (comparison/reference)

### NEVER USE IN UI:
- Fraud detection
- Fraud prevention
- Catches thieves
- Prevents theft
- Stops embezzlement
- Suspicious activity
- Unauthorized expenses
- Red flags (use "needs attention" instead)

## Tone Guidelines

### In-App Copy:
- Supportive, not policing
- Collaborative, not accusatory
- Protective, not suspicious
- Professional, not corporate
- Warm, not cold

### Key Principles:
1. Frame features as protecting the treasurer, not policing them
2. Use "team approach" language (collaborative)
3. Focus on building parent trust, not catching bad actors
4. Keep copy tight and action-oriented (not verbose paragraphs)

## Examples (Good vs Bad)

### Settings Page Headers:
✅ GOOD: "Approval & Protection Settings"
❌ BAD:  "Fraud Prevention Settings"

### Feature Descriptions:
✅ GOOD: "Two-person verification protects everyone"
❌ BAD:  "Prevents fraud with dual approval"

### Button Labels:
✅ GOOD: "Review & Approve"
❌ BAD:  "Approve to Prevent Fraud"

### Success Messages:
✅ GOOD: "Financial safeguards active ✓"
❌ BAD:  "Fraud prevention enabled ✓"

### Error Messages (Self-Approval):
✅ GOOD: "For accountability, expenses must be approved by a different team member"
❌ BAD:  "You cannot approve your own expenses (fraud prevention)"

### Notifications:
✅ GOOD: "Expense pending verification"
❌ BAD:  "Expense pending fraud check"

## Copy Writing Checklist

Before finalizing any UI copy, verify:
1. ✅ No "fraud/embezzlement/theft" language in user-facing text
2. ✅ Uses approved protective terminology
3. ✅ Tone is supportive, not accusatory
4. ✅ Copy is tight and scannable (not paragraph-length)
5. ✅ Frames features as helping the treasurer
6. ✅ Would a volunteer feel trusted (not suspected) reading this?

## When to Reference

Always apply these rules when generating:
- Settings pages
- Dashboard copy
- Button labels
- Form labels and placeholders
- Success/error messages
- Notifications (email, in-app, push)
- Tooltips and help text
- Onboarding wizard copy
- Modal dialogs

## Decision Framework

When unsure about terminology:
1. Ask: "Does this sound supportive or accusatory?"
2. Ask: "Would a volunteer treasurer feel trusted or suspected?"
3. Ask: "Are we protecting or policing?"
4. Replace any "fraud" language with protection/safeguard alternatives
5. If still unsure, refer to `/docs/BRAND-VOICE-GUIDE.md`
